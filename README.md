A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy `lib/constants.dart.template` to `lib/constants.dart`
2. Replace `YOUR_API_BASE_URL_HERE` with your actual API URL
3. Update other configuration values as needed

Note: `constants.dart` is ignored by Git to protect sensitive configuration data.
